  <p style="color:white; font-family: helvetica">Poisened candy and harmful treats have in fact been real life incidents. 
  The common saying <br>“don’t take candy from strangers” dates back to the abduction of Charley Ross <br>in 1874, who 
  was lured into a horse-drawn carriage with a treat and never seen again.<br> On that day, Charley and his brother Walter were playing
  outside of their mansion in the affluent <br>neighborhood of Germantown, Philadelphia. Two unknown men, who had given the siblings
  candy a few times before, approached and<br> said that instead of candy, they had firecrackers to give them. Come, said the strangers, let’s get into our buggy.
  And into the buggy <br>the boys went. In 1974, an eight year old, Timothy O Brien died due to
  Halloween candy laced with cyanide.<br> Now for good reason, the annual rumors continue from poisened candy to <br>chocolate covered razor blades.</p>
