  Poisoned candy and harmful treats have in fact been real life incidents. 
  The common saying <br>“don’t take candy from strangers” dates back to the abduction of Charley Ross <br>in 1874, who 
  was lured into a horse-drawn carriage with a treat and never seen again.<br> On that day, Charley and his brother Walter were playing
  outside of their mansion in the affluent <br>neighborhood of Germantown, Philadelphia. Two unknown men, who had given the siblings
  candy <br>a few times before, approached and said that instead of candy, they had firecrackers to give them.<br> Come, said the strangers, let’s get into our buggy.
  And into the buggy the boys went.<br> In 1974, an eight year old, Timothy O Brien died due to
  Halloween candy laced with cyanide.<br> Now for good reason, the annual rumors continue from poisened candy to chocolate covered<br> razor blades.</p>

    A recurring Halloween myth is the threat of a massacre. One particular photo from 1962 continues<br> to spread a legendary story about 
    a Halloween massacre. The plot goes that the man in <br> the black mask in the photo to the right was at a costume party and decided to lock all the doors 
    in order <br> to attempt murdering each and every guest. Seven partygoers met their end and the man <br>was never caught. It wasn’t until 
    1969 that his mask was found by the FBI. <br>However, the details are vague, but the rumour usually provides just enough specificity to
    make the warning <br> apply to a large section of the population. Stories of supposed historic massacres have been turned into memes, making them 
    easier to spread and appear more authoritative, despite the fact there isn’t a shred <br> of evidence to back them up.</p>

    As Halloween time nears, the "Blue Star" urban legend will most likely resurface playing on parents fears. This legend caused so
    much commotion in the past, flyers were made given to parents as seen on the right. It has also become popular on 
    Internet mailing lists and websites. This legend states that a temporary lick-and-stick tattoo soaked in LSD and made in the form of
    a blue star or of popular children's cartoon characters, such as Mickey Mouse 
    and Bart Simpson, is being distributed to children in the area in order to get them addicted to LSD, even though LSD is rarely 
    addictive. The legend possibly originated from the fact that an LSD solution is sometimes sold on blotter paper with various designs,
    including cartoons. The flyer lists an inaccurate description of the effects of LSD and instructs parents to contact police if they come across the blue 
    star tattoos. No actual cases of LSD distribution to children in this manner have been documented. Furthermore, LSD
    does not penetrate through skin in sufficient quantities so as to induce a psychedelic experience.</p>
