      April to June and late September to October are the best months for traveling in Italy -- temperatures are usually mild and the crowds aren't quite so intense. Starting in mid-June, the summer rush really picks up, and from July to mid-September the country teems with visitors. For warmer weather — without throngs of tourists and the sweltering humidity — come in May or September. High average temperatures flit between the mid-70s and the lower 80s.

      <td>Rome, Italy’s capital, is a sprawling, cosmopolitan city with nearly 3,000 years of globally influential art, architecture and culture on display. Ancient ruins such as the Forum and the Colosseum evoke the power of the former Roman Empire. Vatican City, headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, has St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museums, which house masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel frescoes. Rome’s numerous neighborhoods require some time to fully explore. </td>
      <td>In Rome, expect to find dishes driven by cured pork, Pecorino Romano DOP, and offal. Pasta is taken very seriously here, and some dishes are specific to Rome, such as the tonnarelli cacio e pepe and spaghetti alla carbonara (a rich dish, sauced with raw egg, cheese, black pepper, and guanciale or pancetta). When it comes to meat dishes, lamb is very popular, especially around Easter. Travelers should not miss the traditional fried artichoke dish, carciofi all giudia (Jewish style), in season from February to May.</td>
