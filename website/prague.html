  <p class="overview">
    Prague is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe in terms of its setting on both banks of the Vltava River, its townscape of burgher houses and palaces punctuated by towers, and its individual buildings.

      The best times to visit Prague are the spring and early fall when the weather is mild and there are fewer crowds. Because of the city's generally chilly climate, the warmer summer months (average high temperatures hover in the low to mid-70s) see the largest influx of tourists – which means higher hotel rates.

      <td>Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. Completed in 1402, pedestrian Charles Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints.</td>
      <td>Prague is well-known for its beautiful architecture and beer, but there is so much more to this well-loved city including the Czech food – its diverse flavors presented in dishes such as the potato soup, traditional roast pork with dumplings and sauerkraut, fruit dumplings and apple strudel. Czech cuisine is all about soups and sauces. And if there is one traditional Czech soup, it must be the Kulajda.</td>
